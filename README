RTMP protocol implementation for the Twisted framework.
=======================================================

Another python RTMP implementation, but this one is supposed to match
the twisted design principles closer than other implementations.


Dependencies
============

* Python 2.5+
* Twisted


Installation
============

twimp comes with a distutils setup.py script, so the usual::

  $ python ./setup.py install

or::

  $ python ./setup.py bdist_rpm

should do the trick.
